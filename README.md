## Navigating Layers

![Layer 0](/visual/LAYER0.png)

Layers 0-4 are all alternative layouts (Colemak, Qwerty, etc). By default, you will be on layer 0 (`COLE-DH`).

- To access other layers while typing, you will be holding down either the left layer key for `SYMBOLS`, the right layer hey for `NUMPAD`, or both layer keys at once for `SYSTEM`.
- To change your active layout to one of the other supported ones, hold down both red layer keys at the same time to access the system layer. While still holding the red layer keys, press the key corresponding to the layout you want to switch to, labelled as `TO LYR#`. The other supported layouts can be viewed by [clicking here](LAYOUTS.md).
